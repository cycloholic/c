# 🧠 AI Tic-Tac-Toe (C++)

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe (3x3) game implemented in C++ where you play against an unbeatable AI powered by the **Minimax algorithm**.

## 🎮 How it works

- You are `X`, the AI is `O`
- You take turns placing symbols on the board
- The AI uses Minimax to calculate the best possible move
- The game ends with a win, loss, or draw

## 🛠️ Features

- Terminal-based game
- Uses Minimax algorithm (no pruning)
- Clean and readable code
- Great for learning AI basics in C++
